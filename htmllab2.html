           <p class="content">NEW DELHI: Amid rising complaints, the government has blocked 348 apps developed by various countries, including China, for profiling citizens and transmitting it overseas in an ununauthorised manner, Parliament was informedon Wednesday.</p>
           <p class="deep">By Ankita Garg: The government of India has ordered to ban 54 new Chinese apps, citing that these pose a security and privacy “threat” to users. While many of them are not as popular or widely used in India, the list includes one prominent name -- Garena Free Fire. Surprisingly, the list misses out on the second version of the game, Free Fire Max, which is still visible on Google Play Store.<br><br>

           The government says that these apps are allegedly obtaining critical permissions and assembling sensitive user data. It is being said that the collected data is being misused and transmitted to servers located in a hostile country.<br><br>

           "In addition, there are other serious concerns as some of these apps can carry out Espionage and Surveillance activities via camera/ mic, accessing fine location (GPS) and do malicious network activity similar to previously blocked apps. These apps were allegedly engaged in activities prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of the country also posing serious threat to Security of the State and defense of India," the government said.<br><br>

           Besides, this is not the first time that the government has banned Chinese apps. So far, around 273 apps have been banned in India. Last year in June 2020, popular apps like AliExpress, Weibo, WeChat, and Shareit were banned from the country.<br><br>

           In the last two years, the government has banned 320 Chinese apps under the Information Technology Act,2000.</p>
